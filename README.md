üõ†Ô∏è Want to Tweak It? (Remix Mode)
Swap out the images, change the prices, or actually make the cart work. Go wild! This is your digital playground‚Äîbreak it, fix it, remix it. The only limit is your imagination (and maybe your CSS skills).

Feeling brave? Try adding a real backend. Feeling lazy? Just change the colors and call it a day. No judgment here!

ü§î Why Does This Exist?
Because learning web design should be fun, fearless, and a little bit fabulous. And honestly, who doesn‚Äôt love window shopping for things they‚Äôll never buy?

Also, because sometimes you just want to build something cool without worrying about databases, payment gateways, or angry customers.
